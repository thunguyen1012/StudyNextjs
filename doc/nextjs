Next.js

1) Why is it?
Rendering at the server side: MVC,..
+ SEO engine supports well
- It takes long time for response

Rendering at client side: React, Angular,..
+ Response extreme fast
- First paint: takes much time to download resources
- SEO engine does not work well on

Isomorphic (hybrid) web application: pre-rendering which is needed for SEO or can be eager loaded at server side, render remaining things at client side.
Nextjs goes here.

2) What is it?
Nextjs is a framework.
- Supports to pre-render at server side for React applications
- Export to a static app (html, css, javascript,..)
- CSS-in-JS
- Zero configuration
- Supports to custom: server, routing, plugin,..
- Can be used in the production

3 Pages
A page is a react component. It is saved in the 'pages' directory.
There is a route for each page on its file name.

By default, Nextjs pre-renders every page.

Pre-rendering types:
- Static Generation: html is generated at build time.
- Server-side Rendering: html is generated on each request.

You can "choose" which rendering style to use: Static, Server-side, or Client-side rendering.

3.1 Static Generation
By running: ```next build```

- Only static content: just generate html.
~/.next/server/static/<build id>/pages/index.html

- Need data for page
-> page file must export an async getStaticProps() function. This function will pull the data and return an object that has a ```props``` property.

- Need dynamic urls
-> page must have getStaticProps() function
-> page file must export an async getStaticPaths() function. This function will return an object that has a ```paths``` property.

dynamic route + static page: no need getStaticProps, getStaticPaths
dynamic route + dynamic page: need both getStaticProps, getStaticPaths

Usage: whenever possible
- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

3.2 Server-side Rendering
page file must export an async getServerSideProps() function. This function is invoked by the server for each request.

SSG: static side generation.

getStaticProps() function makes json file this is props while generation. This json data is passed to page component as props.
in dev, getStaticProps() function will be called on every request.

getStaticPaths() function returns object that includes 'fallback' property.
fallback: false -> 404 when page of requesting route wasn't generated.
fallback: true -> new page will be generated when page of requesting route wasn't generated.

getServerSideProps() function has a parameter: context
context {
    params,
    req,
    res,
    query,
    preview,
    previewData
}

getInitialProps() function should not be used from nextjs 9.3, use getStaticProps() or getServerSideProps()
Known issue: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/11014

If a page does not have getInitialProps() function, nextjs can automatic generate html for this page.

useSWR() hook function fetches data at client side. https://swr.now.sh/

4. Routing
Link component from next/link.
href - The name of the page in the pages directory. For example /posts/[id].
as - The url that will be shown in the browser. For example /posts/1.

5. Custom
- Babel: .babelrc file

- PostCSS: postcss.config.json file

- Server: server.js. 
To inject middleware.
Run as a node app: node server.js
 https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server

- App: _app.js file
if _app has getInitialProps() -> no automatic generate html
Persisting layout between page changes
Keeping state when navigating pages
Custom error handling using componentDidCatch
Inject additional data into pages
Add global CSS

- Document: _document.js file.
Use to custom the html, body tags.
if _document has getInitialProps() -> ctx.req will be undefined for pages that are prerendered.
https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document

- Error: _error.js file

React hook

Class Component vs Functional Component

1) What is it?
React hook (react 16.8) is a tool allow use state and do some features without writing class component.
- Reuse stateful logic
Old way: render props, HOC -> wrapper hell
New way: react hook

- Do side effect (fetch data, register event handler, update DOM,..) and clean up.
Old way: componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount
New way: react hook: useEffect

2) How is it?
Functional Component
Common hook: useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer

2.1 Rules
Only call Hooks at the top level. Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
Only call Hooks from React functional component.

2.2 useState
- parameter: anything
- declare a state variable.
- preserve state, update state function between the function calls by React.

2.3 useEffect
useEffect(effectFn, [any]);

do somethings after update DOM.
every time component is re-rendered, react schedules a different effect, replaces the previous one.
effects scheduled by useEffect don't block the browser from updating the screen.
By default clean up is run when component unmounts, before re-running the effect due to a subsequent render.
Can skip effect by the second parameter: if changed then do the effect. an empty array -> do the effect only once
